# restaurant-page

The purpose of this project is to use learn to use webpack and multiple js files to create a site with tabbed browsing to access different pages.  This will be done by manipulating the DOM through the imported js files.

Menu items can be added by adding a new menu item to the names list in itemClass.js.  The ingredients are randomly generated everytime the menu is loaded, which is not ideal for a real restaurant website, but I did this for fun and to practice creating different objects.
